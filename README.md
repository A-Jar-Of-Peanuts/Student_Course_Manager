# Student and Course Manager

## Description
This project is a student and course manager. The user
can add any number of courses to the manager, with each course having its individual 
course description and credit worth. Similarly, the user 
is free to add any number of students to keep track of. 
You can add courses to each student, as well as their grades for
each course. The app can then calculate the weighted average of
all their courses for the user. 

This project can be used by teachers and tutors to keep track of their students'
grades and performance, as well as students themselves to
keep track of their progress. This project is of interest to me
because I am a student, and am pretty concerned with my grades
and courses. This could be a good way to keep track of my performance
and how well I need to do in certain courses in order to get the
grade I want.
